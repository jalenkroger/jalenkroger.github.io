                    <h2>A State in Shortage</h2>
                    <p>Spanning across Nebraska, <strong>88 out of 93 counties</strong> are designated Mental Health
                        Professional Shortage Areas.</p>
                    <p>Nearly 95% of Nebraska counties are identified as having a shortage of mental health
                        professionals, and 29 counties have no behavioral health providers at all.</p>

                    <h2>The Human Cost</h2>
                    <p>The impact is real and devastating. From 2016 to 2022, the suicide rate in rural Nebraska was
                        <strong>20.2 per 100,000 residents</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, the urban rate was 10.0 per 100,000. Rural residents are facing a crisis with half
                        the support.</p>

                <div class="step-content">
                    <h2>The Provider Gap</h2>
                    <p>Access is scarce. Rural Nebraska has only <strong>3 practicing psychiatrists</strong> per 100,000
                        residents, compared to 11.8 in urban areas.</p>
                    <p>Psychologists are also lacking: 8.7 per 100,000 in rural areas versus 27.9 in urban centers.</p>

                    <h2>Distance & Barriers</h2>
                    <p>"Distance is an obstacle because our communities are small and really spread out," says Dr. Cate
                        Jones-Hazledine.</p>
                    <p>With minimal public transportation, the cost of gas and time off work makes traveling for care a
                        significant burden for isolated communities.</p>

                    <h2>Fighting Stigma</h2>
                    <p>Despite the need, stigma lingers. "A lot of our clinicians are currently really worried about
                        young adult men," notes Dr. Jones-Hazledine.</p>
                    <p>In small towns, anonymity is hard to find. Some patients park blocks away to avoid being seen at
                        a therapist's office.</p>

                    <h2>A Glimmer of Hope</h2>
                    <p>Progress is happening. Practicing behavioral health providers in rural Nebraska increased by
                        <strong>24%</strong> recently.</p>
                    <p>Telehealth and school-based programs are helping to bridge the gap, bringing care directly to
                        those who need it most.</p>

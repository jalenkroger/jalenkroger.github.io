                    <p>Eighty-eight of Nebraska’s 93 counties are designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas,
                        according to the Behavioral Health Education Center of Nebraska.</p>
                    <p>Nearly 95% of Nebraska counties are identified as having a shortage of mental health
                        professionals, and 29 Nebraska counties have no behavioral health providers.</p>
                    <p>Rural Nebraskans face barriers and challenges in accessing mental health services and care.
                        Culture, geographic location and accessibility are a few factors that impact mental health in
                        areas like Nebraska’s Panhandle.</p>

                        Health Services Administration.</p>
                    <p>The rate of rural Nebraska resident suicides was <strong>20.2 per 100,000 residents</strong>,

                        compared to 11.8 per 100,000 residents in urban Nebraska.</p>

                    <h2>Isolated communities must travel to seek care</h2>
                    <p>Finding time to travel to appointments can be difficult and takes up a large chunk of the day.
                        Dr. Cate Jones-Hazledine says some patients drive up to an hour to appointments. According to
                        BHECN, some patients drive over an hour.</p>
                    <p>Tara Wilson, a LIMHP counselor at Western Nebraska Behavioral Health in Rushville, Nebraska, and
                        associate professor at Chadron State College, said a barrier that many rural Nebraskans face in
                        accessing mental health services is transportation. There is minimal or no public transportation
                        in rural areas, making it difficult for those who are isolated from services that may be
                        available in another town.</p>
                    <p>Jones-Hazledine, a licensed psychologist and owner of Western Nebraska Behavioral Health, said
                        the costs of transportation are additional barriers that Nebraskans face.</p>

                    <h2>The Cost of Distance</h2>
                    <p>“One of the things that gets in the way of clients being able to travel to appointments is the
                        cost of that, the cost of the gas. Do they have a reliable car? Can they afford to take the time
                        off work that it takes to drive an hour to be seen and then have an hour appointment, and then
                        drive an hour back?” Jones-Hazledine said.</p>

                    <h2>Meeting patients where they are</h2>
                    <p>Jones-Hazledine is a native of rural Nebraska and said she is driven by her mission to help
                        underserved communities that have limited access to mental health services. She returned home as
                        a faculty member of the Munroe-Meyer Institute with the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
                        Later, she converted the clinics into a private practice and expanded it.</p>
                    <p>“I’m from here. That’s the biggest thing. I came home,” Jones-Hazledine said.</p>
                    <p>She has clinics in Rushville, Chadron, Crawford, Alliance, Scottsbluff and Valentine.</p>

                    <h2>Overcoming Distance</h2>
                    <p>Jones-Hazledine said she sees the problem rural patients face – and meets them where they are at.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Distance is an obstacle because our communities are small and really spread out, and so folks
                        very often have to travel a distance in order to access care. That's one of the reasons that we
                        have seven different locations. To try to minimize some of that,” Jones-Hazledine said.</p>

                    <h2>Despite efforts, stigma still lingers in communities</h2>
                    <p>Over the 21 years Cate-Hazeline has been practicing in Rushville, she says stigma around mental
                        health is still very prevalent.</p>
                    <p>“It is still an obstacle, I think, especially for certain parts of the population. A lot of our
                        clinicians are currently really worried about young adult men, especially because we are seeing
                        higher rates of suicide, and that population is historically really hard to get into the
                        clinic,” Jones-Hazledine said.</p>
                    <p>Wilson said the smaller community feel can impact one’s willingness to seek help.</p>

                    <h2>Small Town Barriers</h2>
                    <p>“Other barriers might even just be the small community feel. While some clients want to know
                        everything about their counselor before they go and meet with them, other clients don't want to
                        know a single thing about the counselor,” Wilson said. “So, it's really just a kind of
                        individual preference. It's really hard to go to a counselor that you know nothing about if you
                        don't want to go to a counselor that knows things about you already.”</p>
                    <p>Quinn Lewandowski, who focuses on behavioral health policies at the Nebraska Policy Center and
                        serves as the president of the Nebraska State Suicide Prevention Coalition, also says the
                        small-town feel is impactful.</p>
                    <p>Lewandowski said participants in focus groups described parking their vehicles a few blocks away
                        from their therapist’s office to avoid being seen by others.</p>

                    <h2>Flipping the Script</h2>
                    <p>“Folks like me and a host of other organizations and partners are really trying to flip that
                        script, or flip that narrative, and show that there are people out there that want to help and
                        care and that there's hope for folks. Along the way, we're trying to increase public health
                        messaging around help seeking, and that asking for help is a sign of strength,” Lewandowski
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Lewandowski is working on suicide prevention messaging to reach audiences such as adult men and
                        demographics that are not traditionally targeted.</p>
                    <p>The message is “Live up to a different kind of strength. The strength to ask for help.”</p>

                    <h2>Normalizing Care</h2>
                    <p>Jones-Hazledine is trying to change the stigma in her community through her work with the schools
                        by normalizing mental health care.</p>
                    <p>“We're collaborating with our local school system, and they identify students that they're
                        worried about, or students who have need, or the families identify students, and we go right
                        into the schools, and we provide outpatient mental health, but we provide it in the schools,”
                        Jones-Hazledine said.</p>
                    <p>She hopes that as kids age, mental health practices and care will be normalized in their everyday

                        Wilson said.</p>
                    <p>Telehealth options are available, however, Wilson said some patients prefer in-person provider
                        visits.</p>
                    <p>“Telehealth is absolutely helping us to reach additional clients that we wouldn't necessarily be
                        able to reach,” Wilson said. “It's just not everyone prefers, not everyone wants to do
                        telehealth.”</p>

                    <p>Jones-Hazledine said she has been using telehealth services for 14 years. In her practice,
                        telehealth is supplemented with sessions to increase the frequency of care.</p>
                    <p>There is a state-wide shortage of behavioral health workers throughout the state.</p>

                        <strong>24%</strong> in rural Nebraska. Psychiatric physician assistants increased by

                    <p>Despite improvements in Nebraska’s rural workforce, many residents still face long wait times and
                        provider shortages. Many still must drive over an hour to the nearest provider to seek in-person
                        care.</p>
                    <p>Telehealth appointments cannot fully replace in-person services and care.</p>
                    <p>Rural Nebraska is facing challenges to address the need for behavioral health care, but it is not
                        going unnoticed. Leaders in behavioral health are working together to address residents’
